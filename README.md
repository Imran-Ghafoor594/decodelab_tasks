## Projects

| # | Project | Description | Tech Stack |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | [Rule-Based AI Chatbot](./Rule-Based%20AI%20Chatbot/) | A simple rule-based chatbot with a knowledge-base dictionary, predefined intents, and fallback responses. | Python |
| 2 | [AI Movie Recommender (TF-IDF)](./AI%20Movie%20Recommender%20%28TF-IDF%29/) | Recommends movies using TF-IDF vectorization and Cosine Similarity on genre/language features. CLI + Streamlit web app. | Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit |
| 3 | [AI Image Text Recognition (OCR)](./AI%20Image%20Text%20Recognition%20%28OCR%29/) | OCR app that extracts text from images using EasyOCR, with confidence scores and a Streamlit interface. | Python, EasyOCR, OpenCV, Streamlit |
| 4 | [Iris Flower Classifier (KNN)](./Iris%20Flower%20Classifier%20%28KNN%29/) | Classifies Iris flower species using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, with full evaluation metrics. | Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter |

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Imran-Ghafoor594/decodelab_tasks.git
cd decodelab_tasks
```

Each project is self-contained. Move into the project folder you want to run and install its dependencies:

```bash
cd <project-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then follow the **Run** instructions in that project's own README.
